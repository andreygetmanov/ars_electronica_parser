# Ars Electronica Archive parser

Parses data from [Ars Electronica Archive](https://archive.aec.at/prix/) to a json file.

The data contains info about artwork's name, authors, award, year of nomination, category, description, a list of links to artwork's photos, and also a link to the artwork itself. 

Just run `main.py` to use the parser. 
You can filter the required artworks by years, awards and nominations.

Full Ars Electronica Archive is available in the **data** folder.

If you face `ConnectionReset` problem, try to run the parser in Google Colab.

I will be happy, if you star‚≠ê my repo.
